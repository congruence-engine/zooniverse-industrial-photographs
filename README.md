# Zooniverse & Industrial Photographs


## Short summary
The National Collection Social Machine, as conceptualised by the Congruence Engine thus far, will comprise of data-enhancing processes, as well as socially led processes which encourage engagement with collections data through discussion, knowledge sharing, and other forms of participation. 

This investigation will be part of the broader ongoing experimentation with the Social Machine localised in Bradford and will experiment with some of the crowdsourcing tools developed by the Communities & Crowds project. More specifically, it will be an experiment in utilising an online platform (Zooniverse) which has a social infrastructure centred around participating in a crowdsourcing project. Volunteers on Zooniverse projects can interact with one another using the Talk Forums, as well as a newly developed feature called “Quick Talk”. This case study will test this new Zooniverse feature to better understand if they can facilitate greater community inclusion in the creation of collections metadata.

This investigation will experiment with the social infrastructure on Zooniverse by creating a crowdsourcing project using photographic collections from Bradford and examining the ways in which participants interact among themselves as well as with the photographs online. In addition, we will also examine how participants utilise the tagging features on Zooniverse and how that impacts the ways in which other people can interact with the images there. Ideally, the results from this experimentation will help inform the development of the social infrastructure of the National Collection Social Machine.
